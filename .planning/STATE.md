## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- AI-first categorization: 4,000 videos makes manual categorization impractical
- Consolidate categories before Watch Later: Cleaner target structure improves ML accuracy
- System proposes consolidation, user approves: Balance automation with user control
- Web app deployment: Simpler maintenance vs desktop application
- YouTube as source of truth: Tool assists reorganization, YouTube is primary interface
- Preview capability during review: User needs to watch snippets to remember old videos

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Identified during roadmap creation:**

- **Phase 5 (ML Engine):** Model selection (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) assumed but needs validation during planning — accuracy on YouTube titles/descriptions unknown
- **Phase 8 (Sync):** Conflict resolution strategy not specified in research — last-write-wins vs user prompt depends on actual conflict frequency
- **Phase 8 (Sync):** YouTube API quota increase request timeline unclear — may need to submit early in Phase 1 if 10k units/day insufficient for testing
