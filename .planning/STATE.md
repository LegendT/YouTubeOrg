# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Videos must be findable when needed. If you can't locate a video when you need it, the collection is worthless.

**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Playlist Analysis & Consolidation

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Playlist Analysis & Consolidation)
Plan: 6 of 11 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-06 — Completed 02-06-PLAN.md

Progress: [█████████░░░░░░░] 9/16 plans (~56%)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 9
- Average duration: 4.3 min
- Total execution time: 0.65 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Foundation & API Integration | 5/5 | 23.5 min | 4.7 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- AI-first categorization: 4,000 videos makes manual categorization impractical
- Consolidate categories before Watch Later: Cleaner target structure improves ML accuracy
- System proposes consolidation, user approves: Balance automation with user control
- Web app deployment: Simpler maintenance vs desktop application
- YouTube as source of truth: Tool assists reorganization, YouTube is primary interface
- Preview capability during review: User needs to watch snippets to remember old videos

**From 01-01 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Use serial() for primary keys instead of generatedAlwaysAsIdentity() for simplicity
- Use Drizzle push command for rapid development (switch to migrations for production)
- PostgreSQL via Docker (youtube-org-db container) with max: 1 connection pooling
- Store full API responses in jsonb for 304 Not Modified handling

**From 01-03 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Separate concerns: Bottleneck handles real-time rate limiting, database tracks persistent quota history
- 304 Not Modified responses return cached data from database (0 quota cost vs 1 for fresh fetch)
- Retry on 429 Rate Limit with exponential backoff, no retry on 403 quotaExceeded
- Cache key generation from resource type + JSON.stringify(params) for unique identification

**From 01-02 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Force consent screen (prompt: "consent") to guarantee refresh_token on every login
- Store access_token in JWT session (encrypted) rather than database for serverless compatibility
- Implement token refresh in JWT callback using oauth2.googleapis.com/token endpoint
- Handle revoked tokens (invalid_grant) by setting error flag to trigger re-authentication
- Preserve refresh_token during rotation (newTokens.refresh_token ?? token.refresh_token)

**From 01-04 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Use dedicated syncState table for tracking pagination progress (enables resume after quota exhaustion)
- Batch video IDs in groups of 50 for single videos.list call (1 unit per 50 videos vs 50 individual calls)
- Separate playlist sync and video sync into distinct functions (clearer separation of concerns)
- Delete syncState entry on sync completion, preserve on quota exhaustion (clean transient state)

**From 01-05 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Use Server Components for all data fetching, Client Components only for interactivity (eliminates quota waste on page refresh)
- Dashboard always loads from database, never triggers YouTube API (0 quota cost for page refresh)
- User-triggered sync button with loading state and success/error/partial-success messages (clear user control)
- Explicit authentication checks with redirect patterns (secure by default)

**From 02-01 execution (2026-02-06):**
- Used fast-dice-coefficient instead of unmaintained string-similarity (O(n) vs O(n^2), actively maintained)
- Used ml-hclust built-in group(k) instead of custom cutDendrogram (eliminates error-prone tree traversal)
- Category naming picks most descriptive title from cluster (most non-stopword words, then longest)
- Aggressive/conservative presets via targetClusters parameter (25 vs 35)
- Analysis functions are pure server-side, operating on cached PostgreSQL data (no YouTube API calls)

**From 02-05 execution (2026-02-06):**
- Combined distance metric: nameWeight * (1 - nameSim) + overlapWeight * (1 - videoOverlap) per algorithm mode
- Confidence scoring: 60% name similarity + 40% video overlap, scaled 0-100, with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW levels
- Aggressive preset: 25 clusters, 0.6 name / 0.4 overlap weight; Conservative: 35 clusters, 0.8/0.2
- analysisSessions table tracks staleness via playlistDataTimestamp, finalizedAt marks approved structure
- All new columns nullable for backward compat with 02-01 data
- Watch Later excluded from clustering by both youtubeId='WL' and title check

**From 02-02 execution (2026-02-06):**
- Return proposals even on validation failure (success: false with proposals + errors) so UI can show issues
- Create analysisSessions record per generateConsolidationProposal call for multi-run tracking
- Explicit return type annotations from shared types for server action type safety

**From 02-06 execution (2026-02-06):**
- runAnalysis calls clusterPlaylists directly (not createConsolidationProposals) for finer control over proposal enrichment
- splitProposal inherits sessionId from original proposal for session continuity
- createCustomCategory creates new session if none exists for guaranteed session tracking
- checkStaleness compares max(playlists.lastFetched) against session.playlistDataTimestamp
- bulkUpdateStatus uses inArray for efficient single-query batch updates
- Manual proposals (split/custom) get confidenceScore: 100 with descriptive origin reason

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Identified during roadmap creation:**

- **Phase 5 (ML Engine):** Model selection (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) assumed but needs validation during planning — accuracy on YouTube titles/descriptions unknown
- **Phase 8 (Sync):** Conflict resolution strategy not specified in research — last-write-wins vs user prompt depends on actual conflict frequency
- **Phase 8 (Sync):** YouTube API quota increase request timeline unclear — may need to submit early in Phase 1 if 10k units/day insufficient for testing

**From 01-03 execution (2026-02-05):**

- **Bottleneck reservoir timezone:** 24-hour refresh uses JavaScript Date, YouTube quota resets at midnight Pacific Time. May need timezone adjustment if running in different timezone.

**From 01-02 execution (2026-02-05):**

- **Google Cloud OAuth testing mode:** OAuth consent screen currently in "Testing" mode with limited test users. Will need Google verification process for production deployment with >100 users.
- **Refresh token rotation edge case:** Google may stop providing refresh_token in some refresh responses. Mitigated by preserving old refresh_token, but may need monitoring in production.

**Phase 1 Complete!** All 5 Phase 1 Success Criteria validated.

**Phase 2 In Progress:** Plans 01, 05, 02, and 06 complete. Full backend API with 13 server actions covering analysis workflow: mode-based clustering, proposal CRUD, splitting, custom categories, duplicate resolution, batch operations, and staleness detection. Ready for UI integration (Plans 07-12).
