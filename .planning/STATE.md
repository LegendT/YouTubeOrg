# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Videos must be findable when needed. If you can't locate a video when you need it, the collection is worthless.

**Current focus:** Phase 2 - Playlist Analysis & Consolidation

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 8 (Playlist Analysis & Consolidation)
Plan: 1 of 11 in current phase
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-02-06 — Completed 02-01-PLAN.md

Progress: [██████░░░░░░░░░░] 6/16 plans (~38%)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 6
- Average duration: 4.8 min
- Total execution time: 0.5 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Foundation & API Integration | 5/5 | 23.5 min | 4.7 min |
| 2 - Playlist Analysis & Consolidation | 1/11 | 5 min | 5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-03 (3min), 01-02 (3min), 01-04 (3.5min), 01-05 (6.5min), 02-01 (5min)
- Trend: Stable at ~5 min per plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- AI-first categorization: 4,000 videos makes manual categorization impractical
- Consolidate categories before Watch Later: Cleaner target structure improves ML accuracy
- System proposes consolidation, user approves: Balance automation with user control
- Web app deployment: Simpler maintenance vs desktop application
- YouTube as source of truth: Tool assists reorganization, YouTube is primary interface
- Preview capability during review: User needs to watch snippets to remember old videos

**From 01-01 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Use serial() for primary keys instead of generatedAlwaysAsIdentity() for simplicity
- Use Drizzle push command for rapid development (switch to migrations for production)
- PostgreSQL via Docker (youtube-org-db container) with max: 1 connection pooling
- Store full API responses in jsonb for 304 Not Modified handling

**From 01-03 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Separate concerns: Bottleneck handles real-time rate limiting, database tracks persistent quota history
- 304 Not Modified responses return cached data from database (0 quota cost vs 1 for fresh fetch)
- Retry on 429 Rate Limit with exponential backoff, no retry on 403 quotaExceeded
- Cache key generation from resource type + JSON.stringify(params) for unique identification

**From 01-02 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Force consent screen (prompt: "consent") to guarantee refresh_token on every login
- Store access_token in JWT session (encrypted) rather than database for serverless compatibility
- Implement token refresh in JWT callback using oauth2.googleapis.com/token endpoint
- Handle revoked tokens (invalid_grant) by setting error flag to trigger re-authentication
- Preserve refresh_token during rotation (newTokens.refresh_token ?? token.refresh_token)

**From 01-04 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Use dedicated syncState table for tracking pagination progress (enables resume after quota exhaustion)
- Batch video IDs in groups of 50 for single videos.list call (1 unit per 50 videos vs 50 individual calls)
- Separate playlist sync and video sync into distinct functions (clearer separation of concerns)
- Delete syncState entry on sync completion, preserve on quota exhaustion (clean transient state)

**From 01-05 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Use Server Components for all data fetching, Client Components only for interactivity (eliminates quota waste on page refresh)
- Dashboard always loads from database, never triggers YouTube API (0 quota cost for page refresh)
- User-triggered sync button with loading state and success/error/partial-success messages (clear user control)
- Explicit authentication checks with redirect patterns (secure by default)

**From 02-01 execution (2026-02-06):**
- Used fast-dice-coefficient instead of unmaintained string-similarity (O(n) vs O(n^2), actively maintained)
- Used ml-hclust built-in group(k) instead of custom cutDendrogram (eliminates error-prone tree traversal)
- Category naming picks most descriptive title from cluster (most non-stopword words, then longest)
- Aggressive/conservative presets via targetClusters parameter (25 vs 35)
- Analysis functions are pure server-side, operating on cached PostgreSQL data (no YouTube API calls)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Identified during roadmap creation:**

- **Phase 5 (ML Engine):** Model selection (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) assumed but needs validation during planning — accuracy on YouTube titles/descriptions unknown
- **Phase 8 (Sync):** Conflict resolution strategy not specified in research — last-write-wins vs user prompt depends on actual conflict frequency
- **Phase 8 (Sync):** YouTube API quota increase request timeline unclear — may need to submit early in Phase 1 if 10k units/day insufficient for testing

**From 01-03 execution (2026-02-05):**

- **Bottleneck reservoir timezone:** 24-hour refresh uses JavaScript Date, YouTube quota resets at midnight Pacific Time. May need timezone adjustment if running in different timezone.

**From 01-02 execution (2026-02-05):**

- **Google Cloud OAuth testing mode:** OAuth consent screen currently in "Testing" mode with limited test users. Will need Google verification process for production deployment with >100 users.
- **Refresh token rotation edge case:** Google may stop providing refresh_token in some refresh responses. Mitigated by preserving old refresh_token, but may need monitoring in production.
