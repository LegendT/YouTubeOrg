# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-05)

**Core value:** Videos must be findable when needed. If you can't locate a video when you need it, the collection is worthless.

**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation & API Integration

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Foundation & API Integration)
Plan: 1 of TBD in current phase

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- AI-first categorization: 4,000 videos makes manual categorization impractical
- Consolidate categories before Watch Later: Cleaner target structure improves ML accuracy
- System proposes consolidation, user approves: Balance automation with user control
- Web app deployment: Simpler maintenance vs desktop application
- YouTube as source of truth: Tool assists reorganization, YouTube is primary interface
- Preview capability during review: User needs to watch snippets to remember old videos

**From 01-01 execution (2026-02-05):**
- Use serial() for primary keys instead of generatedAlwaysAsIdentity() for simplicity
- Use Drizzle push command for rapid development (switch to migrations for production)
- PostgreSQL via Docker (youtube-org-db container) with max: 1 connection pooling
- Store full API responses in jsonb for 304 Not Modified handling

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Identified during roadmap creation:**

- **Phase 5 (ML Engine):** Model selection (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) assumed but needs validation during planning — accuracy on YouTube titles/descriptions unknown
- **Phase 8 (Sync):** Conflict resolution strategy not specified in research — last-write-wins vs user prompt depends on actual conflict frequency
- **Phase 8 (Sync):** YouTube API quota increase request timeline unclear — may need to submit early in Phase 1 if 10k units/day insufficient for testing

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-02-05T15:46:30Z

**Next step:** Continue Phase 1 with next plan (YouTube API integration or OAuth setup)
