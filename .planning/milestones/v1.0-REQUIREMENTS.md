### YouTube Sync

- [x] **SYNC-01**: User can preview changes before syncing to YouTube
- [x] **SYNC-02**: System creates new playlists on YouTube with approved structure
- [x] **SYNC-03**: System adds videos to playlists in batches

## v2 Requirements

Deferred to future release. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Learning System

- **ADV-02**: User can organise playlists into nested folders client-side
- **ADV-03**: User can filter by watched status
- **ADV-04**: System shows category growth analytics over time

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Real-time sync | Exhausts API quota; batch operations required for 10,000 units/day limit |
| Video analytics/watch time tracking | Scope creep into different domain; focus is organisation, not analytics |
| Multi-user collaboration | Authentication complexity; single-user tool simpler with better UX |
| Automated playlist creation without review | Low user trust; hybrid approach (AI suggests, user approves) required |
| Video downloading | Legal/ToS concerns; YouTube content stays on YouTube |
| AI-generated summaries | Adds complexity and rate limits; title/description sufficient for categorisation |
| Cross-platform sync (non-YouTube) | YouTube is source of truth; no other platforms needed |
| Native mobile app | Web-first; desktop workflow is primary use case |
| Social features (sharing, collaboration) | Personal tool; no social component needed |
| Video editing/trimming | Out of domain; use YouTube Studio for editing |
| Scheduled/automated categorisation | Explicit user-initiated runs better for trust and control |
| Playlist recommendations | Focus on organisation, not discovery |
